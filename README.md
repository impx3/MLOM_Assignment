**Student Group Analysis & Competition**

Developed a Python-based system to analyze student group memberships and competition participation using set operations, inverted indexing, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project involved:

Identifying common students across multiple groups while applying exclusion rules.
Combining student lists to form a new group.
Implementing an inverted index to determine student participation in competitions.
Using POS tagging (NLTK) to extract proper nouns (NNP) from competition descriptions and identify missing participants.
This project strengthened my skills in file handling, data processing, NLP, and set operations in Python.
