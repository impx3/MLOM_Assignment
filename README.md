**Student Performance Prediction Using Deep Learning**

Built a classification model using TensorFlow to predict student performance levels (Low, Medium, High) based on demographic, academic, and behavioral features. This project involved:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.
Deep learning model design: Experimented with different architectures, activation functions, and dropout layers for optimization.
Training & evaluation: Implemented early stopping, monitored accuracy/loss, and evaluated performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter tuning: Optimized learning rate, batch size, and other parameters for better accuracy.
